evprediction
==============================

This project uses a 1500 home dataset to predict whether or not the house has an electric vehicle and when it is charging. 

# Overview
The goal of this project is to take in a data stream of smart meter power data for a home and do 2 things:
- Predict whether or not the house has an electric vehicle based on energy meter data.
- Predicts exactly when the house is charging (In Progress)

This repo is a package that anyone can download, use and develop further. 

### Data Format:
- 2 months of half hour interval power reading data from smart meters some with electric vehicles and some without.
- The data split is ~70% without EVs and 30% with EVs

### Data Size:
- 1590 houses with 2880 time stamped data points.
